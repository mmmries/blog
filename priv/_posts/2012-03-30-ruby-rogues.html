Have you ever watched a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.confreaks.com/">http://www.confreaks.com/</a>&nbsp;presentation that just blew your mind? &nbsp;Something like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31QrNFyRyc" target="_blank">Code Blindness</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyz3jkOBbQY" target="_blank">How Github uses Github to build Github</a>&nbsp;(language warning)?<br /><br />I love that feeling of realizing, "why haven't I tried that before?" &nbsp;That sense of learning something new is my favorite thing about the ruby community. &nbsp;In the spirit of that sense of awesome learning I highly suggest&nbsp;<a href="http://rubyrogues.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Rogues</a>.<br /><br />This podcast has several of my favorite rubyists that I follow and it even has some fellow Utahns that I hadn't known about before. &nbsp;In addition to that they have guests on the show like Jim Weirich and Kent Beck. &nbsp;Can you say, "scream like a nerdy fan-girl!"<br /><br />I started by listening to their most recent podcasts and quickly went back to start at the beginning and get caught up on the backlog of podcast episodes. &nbsp;They have a great mix of common themes with differing opinions that leave me feeling like, "why haven't I ever done that before?"<br /><br />If you love programming, you will love the podcast. &nbsp;Go Ruby Rogues!</div>
