    Now that my phone is sending video back to my laptop I am ready to start trying to send commands from my phone to the ioio board. &nbsp;Luckily the IOIO comes with a besic test app to make sure that your board is working correctly before you start your own experiments.
    <br />
    Here is the basic process:
    <br />
    1) Solder some headers to the pinouts you plan to use. &nbsp;I just need pinouts for the power, the 5V reference supply and 2 pins that can supply a 5V PWM signal. Not all of the IOIO pins can provide a 5V signal ( <a href="https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki/Digital-IO">https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki/Digital-IO</a>)
    <br />

    </div>
    2) Find a DC power source between 5-15V. A 3 cell lipo that I had hanging around worked fine for me. I'm actually using the balance charging plug because those pins just happen to be the right size for my breadboard prototyping wires.

    </div>
    3) Connect the power source to your IOIO vin and GND headers and you should see the power light come on.

    </div>
    4) Download the softare package for your IOIO (<a href="https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki/Downloads">https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki/Downloads</a>)
    <br />
    5) Install the HelloIOIO.apk file onto your device and start the application.
    <br />

      <img alt="Install-ioio-apk" height="299" src="/assets/images/2012-03-24/cli.png" width="400" />
    </div>
    6) With your IOIO powered, connect the USB cable to your phone.
    <br />
    7) Now you should be able to hit the on/off button and see the status light on your IOIO turn on and off.
    <br />

      <img alt="Hello-ioio" height="506" src="/assets/images/2012-03-24/hello-ioio.png" width="308" />
    </div>
    SUCCESS!! &nbsp;Your phone is talking to hardware! &nbsp;Now it is time to start hacking some servo commands together so we can drive an RC car.
