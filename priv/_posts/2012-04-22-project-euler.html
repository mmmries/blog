<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I have been playing on <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">projecteuler.net</a> recently and I have to reccomend it as an awesome way to play with code. &nbsp;If you ever feel envious of Dijkstra and the other "mathematician programmers" who wrote proofs and theorems while they programmed, this is a good place to dive into the math side of programming.</p>  <p>Sometimes I will rush through several problems in a row and just brute-force the solutions, but other times I get interested in a particular problem or stuck on a particular problem and I will end up spending a couple of hours reading wikipedia articles about various algorithms and mathematical proofs to help me solve a problem.</p>  <p>So if you love math head over to projecteuler.net. &nbsp;If you hate math and love programming, this is a good place to start.</p></div></div>
