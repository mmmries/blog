So after spending (wasting) lots of time thinking about various ways I could keep track of my various technical hobbies I decided to just use the simplest good tool for the job. &nbsp;This blog will basically just be a place for me to write down the things that I am working on in the following areas:<br /><br /><ul><li>Robotics</li><li>Programming</li><li>RC Aircraft (planes and helis)</li></ul><div>I'll backfill some recent content so that blog isn't empty, but mostly I'll be focusing on upcoming projects. &nbsp;The next big project on the list is taking an online computer vision course (<a href="http://www.vision-class.org/">http://www.vision-class.org/</a>) which is slated to start this month. &nbsp;I'll be taking the class along with my programming buddy Duane and I'll have a project to go with it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Roomba! I have played with roombas before and rescued one from the D.I. for $10 which is how I got hooked. &nbsp;For a long time I have thought about using my android phone to act as the brains and sensors for my roomba so I could get it to accomplish more complicated tasks like:</div><div><ul><li>Hunt for a tennisball</li><li>Welcome guests at the door</li><li>Wander around my office and deliver audio messages (trolling people most likely)</li></ul><div>So with the computer vision class coming up I finally ordered a IOIO (<a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10748">http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10748</a>) &nbsp;which I have been thinking about doing for a while so I am just going to buy it and go get my broken roomba out of storage and hook them together. &nbsp;Pictures/videos to come soon.</div></div></div>
